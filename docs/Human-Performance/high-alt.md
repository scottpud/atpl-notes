# High Altitude Operations

## Ozone
- Ozone 03 is produced by action of solar radiation on high altitude oxygen
- Toxic and Damages lungs by destroying elasticity of the tissue (emphysema)
- Little is present in troposphere, but above it rises rapidly
- The Greatest concentrations in Winter and Spring
- Most concentrated between 50 000ft and 100 000ft
- Greater risk on transpolar flights due to tropopause being lower
- Symptoms are
    - Dryness of Nose and throat
    - coughing
    - discomfort in the chest
- Severe poisoning can cause
    - Breathing difficulties
    - Heart strain
    - Sometimes Death
- Concentration of Ozone is more significant than time exposed
- FAA Regulates 0.25 parts per million by volume
- Partly destroyed by high temperatures created in compressors of jet engines
    - Removes most ozone from bleed engine air conditioning
- Aircraft with low compressor temperatures or don't use bleed air
    - Require ozone removers to reduce Ozone to an acceptable level
        - Catalytic Converters
        - Carbon filters

## Radiation
- Radiation becomes more serious at higher altitudes
- Two Components
    - Background Radiation from deep space
        - Fairly Steady
    - Solar Radiation
        - Increases with sun storms and solar flares
- Earths Magnetic Field provides a level of protection
    - Less effective near magnetic poles

### Sun Storms
- Forcasted with NOTAMs
- Increased magnetic field around the earth deflects the increased solar radiation

### Cosmic Radiation Risks
- Cancer
- At 26,000ft up to 3microSv per hour
    - less than the equator 1 - 1.5 microSv per hour
- At 39,000ft effects are doubled

- Mitigating Effects
    - If excessive radiation is detected descend to a lower level
- General measures should be taken to protect aircrew
    - Assess exposure levels
    - Organize work schedules to reduce doses 
    - Inform aircrew about the risks
    - Apply enhanced measures for pregnant aircrew

## Blue and UV Light
- At altitude light is brighter than sea level
- it contains more high energy blue light and ultraviolet
- Pilots should wear appropriate sunglasses for protection
    - Impact resistant with metal frames
    - Good Optical quiality - refractive class 1
    - Have luminance transmittance of 10-15%
    - Filtration standards similar to BS2724

## Low Humdity
- At high altitudes temperature is very low, therefore air holds less water vapor 
- Air is heated to temperature for the cabin
    - capacity to hold water vapor increases but water vapor its self does not
    - RH falls to very low levels
- Around 10-20% in the cabin
- Effects are
    - Thirst
    - Dry Eyes
    - Skin and mucous membranes
- Drinking water, using lip balm, eye drops and aqueous creams will help
